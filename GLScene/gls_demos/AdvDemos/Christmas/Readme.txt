GLScene Christmas 2002 "ScreenSaver".

Won't save your screen from anything though ;)

The scene is made up from a few meshes, some GLScene objects, several
lens-flares and particle effects components, and a 2 text. BASS is used
for the sound part (3D positionned fire loop, and mp3 playback).
Wrapped gifts appear around christmas every year.

Assembled from bits from the web, should be royalty free, but I don't have
the means to check... so if you have clues about any of them:
- Models: from 3DCafe.com, some were altered
- Textures: various origins, some from 3dtextures.fr.st, others made by me
- Music: unknown origin, was in a "royalty free" download package,
  playback via BASS (http://www.un4seen.com/music/)
