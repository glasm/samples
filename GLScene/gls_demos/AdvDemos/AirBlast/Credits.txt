Credits for Resources used in the AirBlast Project

Note that these are credits as far as I knew or remember them,
it's entirely possible that some credits here were misattributed
by me, or were mireported to me. As you'll see, many aren't very
accurate.

*** Models:

- SU37 model is an adaptation of the Facets free model
	http://www.facets3dmodels.com/
- AARAM, AIM9, Gate and Spanner models were made by me, you can reuse 
  them freely, though if you want to do so, you should seriously consider 
  therapy first - they're sooo ugly :)

*** Musics:

- "Circus Polka", by Igor Stravinsky, interpreted by Myron Floren
	http://www.arizona-accordion-club.com/download.htm
- All other musics are from CalpoMatt, downloaded from FlashKit
	http://www.calpomatt.lavista.org/

*** Sounds:

- This is essentially unknown territory, as they came for a personnally
  amassed library of what were supposedly free samples. Some were altered
  by me, all were at least resampled once.
  Most prominent site I remember downloading samples from is FlashKit
	http://www.flashkit.com/index.shtml

*** Terrain:

- Elevation and texture data were generated from TerraGen some time ago
	http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/
- Detail textures are adaptation of free textures from
	http://3dtextures.fr.st/
  (for Detail1.jpg, I'm sure of it, not sure for the other texture)

*** Textures:

- Text textures were made by CoolText's generator
	http://www.cooltext.com/
- GLScene logo was made with the help of an old Xara3D version
	http://www.xara.com/products/xara3d/
- Other textures were made by me, starting from rough materials
  of unknown origin found via Google

*** Voices:

- All voice samples were made with AT&T Natural Voices
	http://www.naturalvoices.att.com/
  I'm not really sure you can use these commercially or anything...
